  <section class="problem">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Most STDs spread not from recklessness — but from silence.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People ghost.</li>
      <li>They don’t swap real names or numbers.</li>
      <li>They don’t know how to have the talk — or don’t want to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>FlingPing bridges the gap between privacy and responsibility. You don’t need to know their name. <strong>Just make sure you pound your PP.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section class="how">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Bluetooth = a silent handshake:</strong> Encrypted, anonymous IDs are exchanged in the background.</li>
      <li><strong>You get tested. It’s positive:</strong> You self-report in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>FlingPing sends anonymous alerts:</strong> To your flings. To their flings. All down the chain. No names. No judgment. Just action.</li>
    </ol>
